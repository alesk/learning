# Patterns And Antipatterns of Learning

This essay is written as the Peear Assessment project for the MOOC [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning
) taught by Terrence Sejnowsky and Barbara Oakley.

Besides the refference to some important topics taught in the course, I tried to bring in
some more real world examples that supports the learning patterns the course advocates. This
additional examples serve to boost motivation and make the readers of the essay more likely to investigate the subject
further.
