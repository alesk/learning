This essay is written as the Peear Assessment project for the MOOC [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning
) taught by Terrence Sejnowsky and Barbara Oakley.

Besides the refference to some important subjects taught in this course, I tried to bring in
some more real world examples that supports the learning patterns the course advocates to
boost motivation and make the readers of the essay more likely to investigate the subject
further.

There is a list of chapters where the topics from the course are addressed. The bolded topic
is considered the main one but list includes the additional ones as well.

1. Break the spell of giftedness: **imposter syndrome** + chunking, einstellung effect,
  focused and diffuse mode of thinking

2. The learning method of Richard Feynman: **illusions of learning** + memory, deliberate practice, chunking, working memory

3. Commit and Get the Job Done: **procrastination** + pomodoro technique, Life long learning and broadeing passions

The citations are listed at the end of the document but are not shown in browser for they
are just turned to hyperlinks at the relevant places in the document. This holds true
for the purely internet resource (blog posts, lecturing videos) as for the books for which the
Amazon page of the book is referenced.
