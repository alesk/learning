# Patterns And Antipatterns of Learning

The following essay is written as a Peer Assessment for the excellent Massive
Open Online Course (MOOC) [Learning How to Learn][8] taught by 
Terrence Sejnowsky and Barbara Oakley.

My main goal is to make you interested in efficient learing techniques
to get a glimps over the subject and to be encoraged to dvelve deeper.

## School Daze 

When I finished University, my systematic educational period was over.
Now, when I think back, I've been attending educational institutions 
for more than 18 years and, there was no real mastery in any of the fields
on my skill belt.

If I new what I now know about how to learn new things, at least from the 
beginning of the high school days, I would, well, gone so frustrated about
the inefficencies of educational system that I would probably just drop out 
in the 1st year and took care for the education by myself.

Paul Grahm in his famous book [Hackers and Painters][2] describes a typical american 
high school as:

> Officially the purpose of school is to teach kids. In fact their primary purpose
is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so the 
adults can get thir things done. And I have no problem with this: in a specialised
industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.

> What bothers me is not that kids are kept in prisons, but that (a) they aren't 
told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly by the inmates. Kids are sent of 
to spedn six years memorizing meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of 
giants who run after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural 
thing in the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail,
they're called misfits.

While a little bit harsh, this concise metaphorical description of incriminated educational
institution is not, be honest, far from the truth. The ones in my country are not that different and
it's no wonder that learning patterns a kid absorbs in such an environment are 
highly inefficient at best.

The bad learning patterns are concisely described in the following excrept from the 
book [A Mind for Numbers][7] by Barbara Oakley:

  1. Passive rereading.
  2. Letting highlights overwhelm you.
  3. Merely glancing at a problem’s solution and thinking you know how to do it.
  4. Waiting until the last minute to study.
  5. Repeatedly solving problems of the same type that you already know how to solve.
  6. Letting study sessions with friends turn into chat sessions.
  7. Neglecting to read the textbook before you start working problems.
  8. Not checking with your instructors or classmates to clear up points of confusion.
  9. Thinking you can learn deeply when you are being constantly distracted.
  10. Not getting enough sleep.

## Break the Spell of Giftedness

We all start with different gifts and talents but the results we achieve 
later in life correlates with natural abilities much weaker we used to belive.

To stretch things a bit more, one can hardly make a kid a worse favor than
by telling her how smart she is. First, it's quite demotivating for there is
really nothing one can do about being or not being smart, it's all inherited.
And there is more. A kid percieved as smart instinctively avoids hard problems
which could cast some doubt about the public image he/she is destined to bear.
This phenomenom even has a name and it's called the [imposter syndrome][9]

As [Dweck and Mueller found out in their study][3], that the kids that were praised for
being smart did about 25% worse at the set of problems as those praised
for their effort.

Threre is a beautiful short blog post by Jamie Begin titled [Hihg IQ Will Kill Your
Startup][1] really worth reading. In short: two guys are attacked by a robber with a knife.
One of them, trained in martial arts in the Isralei army, faces the attacker
with bare hands and manages to disarm him. After the incident, the guys continue their
debate about the role of giftedness:

> The man with the knife did not know how to use that knife. If he had been as trained in knife fighting as I was in hand combat, he would have been able to destroy me. But he had a tool that he felt gave him an advantage, but it’s nothing compared to a person who has no tool, but has worked to develop what he has.

> Intelligence is like a knife. If you are intelligent, you are at a clear advantage against people who are not intelligent. But if you are intelligent, and another person is not as intelligent, but the other person is willing to train harder than you, the other person will very quickly overtake you in ability.

Being smarter means your working memmory is bigger. You may have a place for more
than just 4 chunks but on the other hand with bigger working memory it's easier to
fell pray of [einstellung effect][10], the phenomenon where the idea already present in your mind is
blocking fresh thoughts.

With some smaller working memory, one is forced to retreat to a quiet place to be able to focus
and which opens the door for creativity. Somewhat smaller working memory also means that the prefrontal cortex
doesn't lock up everything so tightly and it easier gets input for other parts of the brain.

If often argue with my colegues about the importance of simplicity and all sorts of trouble one gets into by 
by tolerating (mostly unnecessary excesive) complexity. Your may easily be able to "juggle" with 7 or even 9 (but not 50) balls
with your working memory but you can just as easy create an overly complex system that requires much greater number of chuncks
to be held in working memory at once rendering the subject practically incomprihensive.

Rich Hickey addresed this trap in his famous speech [Simple Made Easy][11]. It's worth watching even if you don't come from
the computer science field.

## The Learning Method of Richard Feynman

One of most famous physicist of 20th century Richard Feynman openly talked 
about his method of acquiering knowledge in a series of essays 
[Surely you are joking, mr. Feynman][6].

Scott H. Young, dubbed "Marco Polo" of leargning in the Course interview, 
presented [Feynman method on his blog in a short video][5].

The gist of the method is, to try to explain an idea on a piece of paper
as trying to teach it to someone. Whenever you stop, or your explanation
becomes wordy and unclear, you hit the "weak point" in your knowledge.

At this point go back to the reference material and try to study a bit more
to come up with better explanation.

It's worth noting that one must try to explanin the subject first **without looking
at the reference** for this is the only way to demonstrate deep knowledge.

This method also resonates with my favorite bullet of the 10 rules of good studyng:
**use recall**. I cant emphasize enough how importan it is to generate (not just reproduce) the 
answers and explanations entirely from your brain.

## The 10 good habits of studyng

Here is a excrept of 10 rules of good studyng from the book 
[A Mind for Numbers][7] by Barbaa Oakley:

  1. Use recall.
  2. Test yourself.
  3. Chunk your problems.
  4. Space your repetition.
  5. Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice.
  6. Take breaks.
  7. Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies.
  8. Focus.
  9. Eat your frogs first.
  10. Make a mental contrast.

## Don't just go shopping, commit and get job done

When I first came to the Cursera Site, I found lots of intersting course. 
I picked a dozen of them and, you guessed, finished none. Mostly, I watched 2 or 3 videos and the lost
interest. I leater recognised this effect as someone masked [procrastination][12]. Every time, were there was
an obstacle requireing to put in some effort to change my brain, I quit and change the attention to some
easier subject offering me the relief from the (brain changing) pain and a ["marshmellow to eat" now
instead of two at a later time][13].

Frustrated by a failure to complete a single course, I decided, to do just
one at a time, just one. I signed for the Data Analysis and Statistical Inference
and to boost motivation even more, I paid for the Verified
Certificate. I worked a lot, much more than I anticipated at the beginning,
but it was worth. I completed the course with 98% and recive the certificate with distinction.
Than I took another course, and another, and another.

Today, I am a happy camper at Coursera, Udacity and EdEx. What about you?
